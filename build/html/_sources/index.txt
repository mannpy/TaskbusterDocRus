TaskBuster Django Ð£Ñ‡ÐµÐ±Ð½Ð¸Ðº
=========================================

I am really excited to present this **Django tutorial**, made with Django 1.8 and Python 3.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a Django Project from scratch.

I will focus in a simple Task manager project, but the idea is that you can follow this tutorial while building your own project.

Specially during the first posts. And you will be able to download a Django Project Boilerplate too! ðŸ™‚

However, this is not a common Django tutorial.

It is much better: it is like a check list to create a complex Django project.
